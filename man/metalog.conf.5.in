.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
[default values] will be used if you do not redefine them in a section.
You can choose <section title> as you wish. It doesn't mean anything, just
allow you to keep an easy to read config file.

Values names can be one of the following:
.TP
.B maxsize
maxsize = <value>. Once a logfile has exceeded the value defined (in bytes), it
will be rotated. If maxfile is equal to zero, it disables log rotation. Defining
a default value is a good idea.
.TP
.B maxtime
maxtime = <value>. Once a logfile is older than the value defined (in seconds),
it will be rotated. Defining a default value is a good idea.

NB: a logfile is rotated when either maxsize or maxtime limit is
reached. If either one or both is equal 0, then log rotation is disabled.
.TP
.B maxfiles
maxfiles = <value>. This value indicates the maximum number of rotated files
kept. So you'll have x rotated files (log-date-string filename type), plus the
file named current.
.TP
.B facility
facility = "name". Only records a message if the application that issued it
uses syslog facility <facility>. Facility names are : "auth", "authpriv",
"cron", "daemon", "ftp", "kern", "lpr", "mail", "news", "security", "syslog",
"user", "uucp", "local0", "local1" ... "local7" . All kernel messages are logged
with facility "kern". A section can have several "facility = ..." lines to match
more than one facility. If <facility> is "*", it'll match all the facilities.
.TP
.B break
break = <value>. Default is 0. If set to 1 and a section is matched, perform
action, but don't consider any more possible section matches below this one in
the config file. This is useful for creating a config where specific types of
log messages are matched and dispatched, while a "catch-all" section at the
bottom of the config file handles the default case.  Using break=0 would cause
messages to be potentially handled by multiple sections, causing message
duplication, while using break = 1 on the sections above the "catch-all" would
avoid duplication.
.TP
.B minimum
minimum = <level> : Only record a message if its urgency is inferior or equal to
<level> . Level '0' is the most critical one, while level '7' is for debugging
messages. 'minimum = 5' will strip all non-important messages. The default
minimum level is 7 (ie. keep all messages).
.TP
.B maximum
maximum = <level> : don't log if the message level exceeds that value. By
default, maximum is the largest possible level.
.TP
.B logdir
logdir = "/path/where/logs/will/be/written" : files will be written in
/path/where/logs/will/be/written.
.TP
.B program
program = "name". Can be used when a facility is useless. Remember to use
the executable name.
.TP
.B regex
regex = "perl compatible regular expression". Can be used when you want to log
given patterns, like invalid, fail etc to get in a given directory everything
that failed or was invalid. Several regex can be defined in a section.
.TP
.B neg_regex
neg_regex = "perl compatible regular expression". Can be used when you want to log
the opposite of given patterns. Several neg_regex can be defined in a section.
.TP
.B postrotate_cmd
postrotate_cmd = "/path/to/a/program". Run specified program after a log file
has been rotated. The program is passed the date, the program name ("metalog"),
and the new logfile name.
.TP
.B program_regex
program_regex = "perl compatible regular expression". Can be used when you have,
for example a familly of programs having the same pattern in their names, and
you want to get logs centralized in a given path.
.TP
.B program_neg_regex
program_neg_regex = "perl compatible regular expression". Can be used when you
want to log programs which do not match a pattern in their names. Several
program_neg_regex can be defined in a section.
.TP
.B showrepeats
showrepeats = <value>. Set to 0 to filter out repeat log messages.
.TP
.B command
command = "/path/to/program/to/execute". If something is logged in a given section,
you can automatically launch a program. The log message is passed as the arguments
to the program. The argv[1] is the date, argv[2] is the program, and argv[3] is the
actual log message.
.TP
.B stamp_fmt
stamp_fmt = "%b %e %T". Format of the human readable timestamp prepended to all
log messages. This format string is passed literally to the
.BR strftime (3)
function. An empty string is used to disable timestamping (for cases where the
logger already does its own timestamping).
