Title: metalog
Version: @VERSION@
Entered-date:  9 Jul 2001
Description: Metalog is a modern replacement for syslogd and klogd. The
logged messages can be dispatched according to their facility, urgency,
program name and/or Perl-compatible regular expressions. Log files can be
automatically rotated when they exceed a certain size or age. External shell
scripts (e.g., mail) can be launched when specific patterns are found.
Metalog is easier to configure than syslogd and syslog-ng, accepts unlimited
number of rules and has (switchable) memory bufferization for maximal
performance.
